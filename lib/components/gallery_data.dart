        "This site was my take on a creative layout with a lively theme that incorporates sliding panels with moving backgrounds.  Having worked in the restaurant and bar industry for years this is the sort of website I would envision for many of the places I worked at.  Their actual websites were always lifeless, so the goal here was pizazz, and a demo in using state to make layout changes on the flu."

        "I recently found the need to find a way to quickly determine if my girlfriends train was close to arriving at our station every morning when I dropped her off.  And on her way home I wanted to know when she'd be arriving so I wasn't wasting time waiting for her if the train was running late. But the public site for this information was so slow to load and the UI was so cluttered you could barely see the map when it did!  So I created this to fill that need and out of a curiosity about how to consume GTFS-RT data feeds and how to use polyline data with Google Maps.  I quickly found there was loads of interesting information I could add to my app after exploring the various responses, and decided to add alert information, train stop locations, color coded routes.  This app is currently in testing through Apple TestFlight but I plan to submit it to the App Store soon so stay tuned!"

I always started at the bottom but worked my way up to manage at Sushi Rama, went from food running to bartending at For[a]ged and The Pig & The Sprout, and held jobs in both bartending and production at Mile High Spirits.  I've you've had the Denver Dry Gin, I might have blended and bottled your batch!  I also gave educational tours of the distillery showing people how we transformed raw ingredients into a variety of spirits!"
